# CubeMX-ST7789
## Overview
CubeMX uses C code, not C++.

Adafruit distributes "Adafruit 1.54" TFT ST7789 C++ library".

It does not works in the code generated by CubeMX because C code can't detect class. 

So we ported C code which based on GPIO.

## Discription

### Font.h
* Size of "FONT8_n#" is 6x11 pixel, and # means ASKII code.  
* Size of "FONT2_n#" is 16x24 pixel, but only numbers and ":", "." we changed from "FONT8_n#".
* Size of "FONT1_n#" is 24x32 pixel, but only numbers and ":", "." we changed from "FONT8_n#".
